Tech-Support Bot

This is a simple console-based bot that simulates a tech support interaction. It focuses on solving one of the most common issues in tech support: asking the user to restart their device.

Purpose
The goal of this program is to reduce unnecessary tech support calls by addressing problems that can be resolved through a simple restart.
According to industry estimates, approximately 60% of tech support cases are solved by restarting the device.

By automating this process, this bot can:

Decrease call volumes for tech support teams.

Free up resources for more complex issues.

Improve overall customer satisfaction.

How It Works

The program:
Asks the user to describe their issue.
Checks if the user has restarted their device.
Loops until the user confirms theyâ€™ve restarted.
Escalates the issue (simulated) if a restart does not solve the problem.

Features
Typewriter Effect: Mimics a more natural interaction, making the bot feel less robotic.
Input Validation: Ensures responses are clear and actionable (e.g., "Yes" or "No").
Simple Logic: Keeps the process user-friendly while effectively guiding the user.

Usage
Compile and run the program in a C++ environment.
Follow the bot's prompts to simulate a tech support scenario.
Why It Matters
Implementing a system like this can:

Save time for support agents.
Save costs by reducing repetitive interactions.
Provide an automated first line of troubleshooting for common problems.
